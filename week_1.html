        I saw this word on an instagram post by an environmental justice organization. Although I’ve heard this word countless times in my life, something about it just stuck out to me in that moment. I started thinking about what it means to be a rebel.<br><br>

        According to Dictionary.com, a rebel is someone who “refuses allegiance to, resists, or rises in arms against the government or ruler of their country” or “a person who resists any authority, control, or tradition.” I don’t necessarily agree with either of those definitions, the first one seeming too narrow and the second seeming too broad for me. I don’t think rebels have to resist ANY control of tradition, some rebels have very specific causes that they fight for. And I don’t think that rebels need to necessarily fight against their specific country or government, it is possible to rebel against issues that are either quite local and informal, or that cross national borders.
        <br><br>
        This rumination led me to thinking about what an ideal, or perfect rebel should be, which I wrote a short and unpolished poem about:

        “Perfect Rebel”<br><br>


Don't you wish you could be the perfect rebel?<br>
History will say that no one ever did it better<br>
And you never broke a window in your life<br>
Never held up traffic at half past five<br>
Never got your boots dirty<br>
And kept your name clearer than crater lake<br>
After you cleaned out all the trash<br>
And saved the fucking day<br>

Some people want a god<br>
Whose every word they can cling to<br>
Clear as a chime, every syllable rings true<br>
Cuz people are rotten<br>
They’ll kiss then betray you<br>
They’ll keep more secrets <br>
than the soil of egypt<br>
It’s true<br>
And I admit sometimes I wish for that too<br>

And at the end of the world<br>
You can sleep peacefully <br>
Knowing everyone <br>
Will know you to be <br>
The perfect rebel<br>
But history is history<br>
And there is no gold for your name to be carved in<br>
You better hope heaven is real<br>

        I designed this tote bag for another class. It is a lyric I wrote about being different from others and doing what you want regardless of what society thinks. I think this is the truest and simplest form of rebellion.

        Some consider to be dying your hair bright colors a form of rebellion. I dyed my hair bright red this summer and it made me feel good about myself. The beauty industry teaches people to be insecure about themselves and sells them products to "fix" that. So you could argue that I am not rebelling, by buying into this industry. But on the other hand, I think confidence is a sort of rebellion. Will think more on this later.
