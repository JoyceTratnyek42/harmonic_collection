This week has been molded from the waxy snot of Satan’s head cold. It started with me having a vision of a 9.0+ earthquake destroying my home and killing my family. And then it went downhill from there. <br><br>

I was heartbroken to learn that the members of BTS (see my last entry) would be leaving for mandatory military service soon. I was even more upset when my best friend didn’t even mention it to me at all, knowing how much they meant to me, and knowing she must have seen what happened on the news. I was painfully reminded of earlier this year, when one of my favorite musicians died suddenly and I recieved radio silence from her as well, despite the event being covered extensively in the news. I cried during my typography studio class.<br><br>

Then came Saturday afternoon. A warm, cloudless day full of exciting potential. I finished up my homework for that day before noon, and then put on makeup and a comfortable outfit to go to the market at union square. I won’t relay what happened next, for a variety of reasons, but I will say that it launched me into the deepest misery of my life. When I was 7 and my parents forced my-non-athletic-self to do a ten mile hike in 70+ degree heat? Or another time when they made me do it in 8 degree cold? Those days had nothing on this.<br><br>

Every waking millisecond, I was haunted with the thought of what I had done, and worse, the terror of what may result. There was no doubt in my mind that my future was doomed. I was so disgusted with myself that I felt the urge to repel myself from my own body, to somehow escape my own consciousness. The thought of killing myself became more and more intense until it seemed inevitable. I couldn’t escape visions of me taking the boxcutter knives in my drawer, and slashing one of the big arteries in my throat in one fell swoop. I slept the whole day on Sunday, as I couldn't bear to face being awake. On monday, I hatched a plan to fix what I had done. It was a risky plan–it had the power to either ruin or save my life in the span of a few hours. But regardless of whether it worked or not, I knew I had to try it. It was the right thing to do, after all. By Monday afternoon, it was all over. I had righted my wrongs, so cleanly that no person on earth would ever know the difference. I walked out of the blood red doors with a brand new spring in my step. I was free.<br><br>

That day, my best friend finally texted me to ask how I felt about the BTS news, which by that time seemed like a relic of an ancient era, when in reality it had been less than a week. I confided in her about what I had gone through and the support she gave me in return was like a breath of fresh air. I couldn’t believe that I had ever doubted her for a second.<br><br>

Ever since I was little, I’ve wondered if maybe I have precognitive abilities. I remember once when I was 10, I had these intense visions of a dark horse named “beau” rearing up. In the background, his barn was on fire. Later that year, I learned that in fact, Beau had died a month ago and the barn had suffered a small fire (not enough to cause any major lasting damage, but still.) In high school, my teacher wrote all our names on a jar full of popsicle sticks and would pull randomly from the jar to select who would have to answer his next question. 90% of the time, I could guess the name before he announced it. So that was why, when I started to get a bad feeling in my stomach about my hometown, I didn’t brush it off. Besides, in this case, the science agrees with me. I am from Portland, Oregon, USA, which sits on top of what’s called the Cascadia Subduction Zone. While our more popular southern neighbor, California, gets all the attention for its frequent and relatively minor earthquakes, Oregon, which is on a different fault line, barely has them. The last major one was in 1700, before white settlers even came to the region. Later, scientists had to piece together native american oral histories (which told of entire settlements being washed out to sea) as well as psychical clues in the landscape (look up “ghost forests” and Japan’s “orphan tsunami”) to figure out what had happened. By the time scientists figured this out, the entire city of portland and pacific northwest region as I know it had already been built–and not to code. Recent research shows there is great cause for alarm, the entire northwest coast will likely be ruined. The “big one” as my sister and I jokingly call it, will probably be at least a 9.0, with a tsunami up to 100 feet tall. Overall, the risk of such a quake in the next 50 years is at least 15%.<br><br>

My family has taken measures to prepare for such an event, such as stocking water, dried food, medical kits, etc, in our home. However, this individual action is no match for the fact that over 80% of the infrastructure in our region is not prepared for an earthquake.<br><br>

I have teased my sister, who lives in Portland with the rest of my family and is a survival preparedness enthusiast, about this. “I wouldn't go to the beach anytime soon if I were you!” She is fed up with me. I joke because I don’t know what to do with this very real fear. There is nothing the people of Portland can do to keep themselves safe, really, except move (as many local geologists have actually done.) There is truly nothing that can be done to help or fix this.<br><br>

I still don’t fully understand my premonitions. The one I had after Saturday afternoon turned out to be just anxiety, not a magical psychic prophecy. And my suspicion of my best friend turned out to be unfounded, too. Maybe I’m not so psychic after all. Maybe I just have anxiety. But I feel hopeful as I write this. I hope my good premonitions come true, and not the bad ones. As I write this, I’m listening to “Brighter Days are Before Us” by me and my best friend’s favorite band. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/LShfYZWyOo0">Brighter Days (Are Before Us)</a><br><br>
