        This is the first week of October, which for me signals the start of fall. The weather here in NYC has matched that, with the air becoming brisk and melancholy, and some chestnut colored leaves landing at my feet when I walk outside. Fall is my favorite season. Winter is much too cold for me and also triggers some intense depression (although that is present in the rest of the year as well). Spring weather is too unpredictable and I am allergic to most spring-blooming plants. Summer brings even more allergies. Fall feels like a respite to me. <br><br>
        
        Also, my best friend’s name is Autumn. So I love this season even more because it reminds me of her. I think there is something inherently sad about this time of year, something that feels strangely comforting to me. Maybe because fall is a season of decay and death. Maybe because Autumn lives thousands and thousands of miles away from me, and this season simply reminds me of the distance between us. It’s hard to articulate this feeling, so I have attached assorted quotes, pictures, videos, and songs that remind me of this feeling. (Some of these things are created by me, others are not, and I have credited where applicable.) I imagine the result as being disorganized but yet somehow still beautiful, like an array of fallen leaves on the ground. <br><br>

        I went full-moon-watching this week on the high line, my monthly tradition. It was a perfect fall night, breezy but not too cold, and clear. Here is a video I took.<br><br>
        There is a sense of vitality in the crisp air. Why is it so fun to be scared? Why is it so comforting to be sad? Why are the truest feelings the hardest to explain?<br>
